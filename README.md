# oculus
This repository contains prototype of credentials scanning and management for various services. Currently It supports Github and Confluence.

**Currently supported component:**
- Oculus Auditor
- Oculus PreCommit Hook

## What do I mean by credential auditor
It is just an idea/prototype that shows how you can find the hardcoded credentials in various services like Git Hub, gitlab, jira, confluence, etc. 


## Future Scope
- Can be extended to other services like Gitlab, Bitbucket, JIRA, etc.
